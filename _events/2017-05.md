## Friends of #Play14
#Play14 is an unconference: the programme will be defined by the participants who are free to sumbmit contents and to decide the schedule.
While remaining faithful to the unconference format, again for the Milan 2017 edition we will be emphasising the **“cultural contamination”** concept. Therefore, we have invited people with different backgrounds and skills, who share a strong interest in gaming as a business tool.
We created the **#Play14 Friends programme** in order to involve trainers, coaches, agile coaches, scrum masters and all kinds of agilists, psychotherapists, UX experts, improvisational theatre actors, musician and so on…
