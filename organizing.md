## How do I become a #play14 event organizer ?

The main condition to become a **#play14** organizer, is that you have to have attended **at least one**.
The reason for that is that we want you to feel what it is like to be part of this family, and comprehend the mindset that we are looking for.

We recommend that you have at least 3 local organizers. 

Most of what you will have to do as an organizer is provide
  * A venue
  * A date
  * Food & drinks
  * Some material for playing
  * Your good mood

The rest is up to the players.


## How do I choose a venue ?

The venue should be big enough to hold 30 to 70 people, depending on how many people you expect.
Our venues are usually special locations, with a sort of nice "je ne sais quoi".

The venue should have at least
  * A common area where the whole group can gather for ice breakers and warm-ups
  * A food corner where people can grab a bite and drinks
  * At least 3 separate gaming areas, big enought to have people walk around tables

  * Tables & chairs (should come with the venue)
  * Whiteboards & paperboards
  * Lots of stiky notes
    * Large stickies for the market place
    * Square (yellow & colors)
    * Long (yellow & colors)
  * Sharpies & Markers
    * At least one Sharpie for each per player

    * Any other game you can think of

  * Lunch : Light lunch, if possible different from the day before to provide variety

## What about budget & revenue ?

We try to keep the price for a ticket as low as possible, because we want that as many people as possible can participate.
The money serves for food & drinks, welcome kits, materials & supplies.

### Tickets

Ticket sales are the main source of revenue for a #play14 event.

Depending on the location and the decision of the local organizers, the price of the tickets might be increased.

Some events manage to get a venue for free. This makes things much easier in terms of budget.
If you need to pay for a venue, the price of the tickets will have to increase and you might want to save money on the rest.

The types of ticket can also be adapted. Some organizers want to sell only tickets for the whole event, some sell tickets per day.
Some organizers setup an evolutive princing : early birds, normal birds and late birds.

All of this can be discussed with the co-founders and some of the other local organizers who can provide some ideas, depending on your context.


### Sponsors

Ideally, you should find sponsors to help you organize a quality event.

The sponsoring can take many forms
  * Money
  * Free venue
  * Food & drinks
  * Materials
  * Games

It's up to you as a local event organizer to find some sponsors for the event you organize.


### Participation for the co-founders

As a rule, we want to have at least one of the origianl co-founder present at any **#play14** event.
Because this incurs some travelling and accomodation fees, part of the budget of a **#play14** event is dedicated to that.

### Profit & loss

**#play14** is non-profit. Any benefit you make is reinvested in the next event.
In the meantime, any financial loss you might suffer will be supported by the **#play14** global organization.
