Setup

Have people stand up in a circle.

 

How to play

The goal is to count to 33 as a group, but you have to replace all numbers containing 3 or multiple of 3 by clapping your hands.

The first person starts counting 1

The second person (direct neighbor) counts 2

The third person claps

And so forth…

The person who makes a mistake should be the one starting over to 1.
