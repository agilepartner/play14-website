Setup

Have people pair up.

 

How to play

Phase 1 :

First person counts 1

Second person counts 2

First person counts 3

Second person counts 1

First person counts 2

Second person counts 3

Phase 2 :

Start over on the same rhythm but replace the number 1 with a gesture, like clapping your hands, jumping or touching your nose.

Each pair come up with their own gesture. It should be the same within the pair, but different among pairs.

Phase 3 :

Start over on the same rhythm, keep the gesture replacing the number 1, and find a different gesture to replace the number 2.

Your pairs should have now two gestures, and only speak number 3.

Phase 4

You guessed it, the last phase is to replace the number 3 by yet another gesture.
