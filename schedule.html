      <h3>Unconference</h3>
      <p><strong>#play14</strong> is organized as an unconference. An unconference is a conference format where attendees are also session contributors.</p> 
      <p>Anyone who wants to initiate a topic can claim a time slot in the agenda.</p>
      <p>There are some simple <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_principles_and_one_law' target='_blank'>rules for participants</a>.
      </p>
      <h5>Principles</h5>
      <ul>
          <li>Whoever comes is the right people</li>
          <li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
          <li>Wherever it is, is the right place</li>
          <li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have, be prepared to be surprised!</li>
          <li>When it's over, it's over</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>The Law of Two Feet</h5>
      <p>Any time a person feels a session is not contributing to their learning needs they have the responsibility to themselves to get up and move, that is use their two feet or four wheels to move to a more interesting place.<p>

      <h5>Bumblebees and Butterflies</h5>
      <p>Bumblebees fly from group to group cross-pollinating the discussions.</p>
      <p>Butterflies sit around looking relaxed and interesting discussions may emerge around them as people find them and pause to chat.</p>
